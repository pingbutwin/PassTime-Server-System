This PassTime Server System is a high-performance Java 8 network application designed to calculate the duration between dates using a non-blocking architecture. The implementation leverages Java NIO (Non-blocking I/O) with Selector, SocketChannel, and ByteBuffer to handle multiple concurrent client connections within a single thread, significantly optimizing resource usage. It features an asynchronous multi-client simulation powered by an ExecutorService and CompletableFuture, allowing parallel processing of client tasks defined in YAML configuration files parsed via the SnakeYAML library.
The core logic resides in a specialized Time module that utilizes the Java Time API (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) to compute precise differences in days, weeks, and calendar periods, with full support for Polish localization and timezone awareness. Communication is managed through a custom string-based protocol validated by Regular Expressions, ensuring robust command processing for logins, date queries, and log transfers. The server maintains both global and per-client logs, providing a transparent audit trail of all network activities and time-calculation results.
